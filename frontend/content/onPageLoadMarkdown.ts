1. Request is sent to an AI worker via Worker API and AI Gateway. The AI Worker uses the stable-diffusion-xl-lightning model to generate an image based on a randomized prompt.  
2. The randomly generated image is stored and optimized in the Cloudflare Images service.  
3. Return the public URL of the generated images to the Next.js frontend and then display the image.  
4. The request is sent to an AI worker through the Worker API and AI Gateway. The AI Worker utilizes the llava-1.5-7b-hf model to produce a textual description of the randomly generated image. Subsequently, the bge-base-en-v1.5 model is employed to generate a 768-dimension text embedding of the AI image description.  
5. The text-embedding is stored in Cloudflare's vector database.   
6. The description of the image generated by the AI is sent back to the frontend application.
